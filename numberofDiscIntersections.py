#### Problem ####
# We draw N discs on a plane. The discs are numbered from 0 to N − 1. An array A of N non-negative integers, specifying the radiuses of the discs, is given. The J-th disc is drawn with its center at (J, 0) and radius A[J].
# 
# We say that the J-th disc and K-th disc intersect if J ≠ K and the J-th and K-th discs have at least one common point (assuming that the discs contain their borders).
# 
# The figure below shows discs drawn for N = 6 and A as follows:
# 
#   A[0] = 1
#   A[1] = 5
#   A[2] = 2
#   A[3] = 1
#   A[4] = 4
#   A[5] = 0
# 
# 
# There are eleven (unordered) pairs of discs that intersect, namely:
# 
# discs 1 and 4 intersect, and both intersect with all the other discs;
# disc 2 also intersects with discs 0 and 3.
#### Write a function:
# 
# def solution(A)
# 
# that, given an array A describing N discs as explained above, returns the number of (unordered) pairs of intersecting discs. The function should return −1 if the number of intersecting pairs exceeds 10,000,000.
# 
# Given array A shown above, the function should return 11, as explained above.
# 
# Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
# 
# N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
# each element of array A is an integer within the range [0..2,147,483,647].

    intersections, active_circles = 0, 0
 
    for _, is_beginning in circle_endpoints:
        if is_beginning:
            intersections += active_circles
            active_circles += 1
        else:
            active_circles -= 1
        if intersections > 10E6:
            return -1
